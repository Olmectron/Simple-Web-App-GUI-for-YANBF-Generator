# Simple Web App GUI for YANBF Generator


This was built using [Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-starter-kit) template. Head there to understand about how to fork or contribute to this project.

And here is the [Electron JS Project Page](https://www.electronjs.org/) for building web app wrappers.

This is only a GUI for the [lifehackerhansol](https://github.com/lifehackerhansol) Python project [YANBF Generator](https://github.com/lifehackerhansol/YANBF). You need to follow their instructions and then put the executable in the same directory as `generator` (`generator.exe` on Windows).


### Usage

#### Prerequisites
