# YANBF Generator GUI



This was built using [Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-starter-kit) template. Head there to understand about how to fork or contribute to this project.

And here is the [Electron JS Project Page](https://www.electronjs.org/) for building web app wrappers.

This is only a GUI for the @lifehackerhansol Python project [YANBF Generator](https://github.com/lifehackerhansol/YANBF). You need to follow their instructions and then put the executable in the same directory as `generator.py`.

For now, there's only a **Windows x64 executable**, but you may try to create an OSX or Linux executable file from source. I'll add those myself later to the releases page.  

### Usage

##### Prerequisites

Follow installation instructions from [YANBF Generator](https://github.com/lifehackerhansol/YANBF).


##### Installation and Usage

1. Download your executable file (only **Windows x64 EXE** file for now).
2. Put that file in the same directoy as `generator.py`.
3. Double click it for starting it up (it can take between 5 and 15 seconds for a window to open).
4. Make sure to select or write your command/location of Python 3.
4. Add NDS files and click the pink button in the bottom-right corner.
5. Wait for the process to finish.
6. Done!

This is just a simple Web GUI embedded in an Electron app.
